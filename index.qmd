## Hi! Welcome!

I created this website to share my interests, skills, and experiences.

### About me

I was born and raised in Half Moon Bay, CA, but have spent that last four years attending the University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing a degree in environmental studies. I have many interests within the field of environmental studies, including wildlife conservation, environmental justice, and climate change. In my free time, you can find me outside hiking, running, or playing playing frisbee with my dog.

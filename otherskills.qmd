### Coding

Although my coding journey is just beginning, I have already become apt at analyzing data, creating figures, and building websites (like this one!) in Rstudio. I know I have just scratched the surface of coding possibilities, but I have developed the foundational understanding and resourcefulness to learn new coding skills and I am excited to grow them! Here is an example of a figure I made.

### Bilingualism

I am fluent in English and Spanish. My mother is a native Spanish speaker so I started speaking Spanish from a very early age. I also went to a Spanish immersion elementary school where I developed Spanish reading and writing proficiency. Being bilingual has enabled me to connect with a broader range of people and expose me to more ideas and cultures. This was part of what inspired me to pursue a minor in Latin American and Iberian Studies.

### Writing

I have attached some pieces that showcase my writing.

This is a research paper I wrote about the role of bilingual education in the Chicano struggle for educational equity for a class called History of Chicanos that I took at UCSB. [read](HIST168BPaper.pdf)

I took a conservation planning class at UCSB in which we worked for 10 weeks in groups to create a conservation plan. Ours focuses on conserving Giant Sea Bass in California kelp forests. This isn't all my writing as I worked with 4 other people, but most of it is and it exemplifies my ability to collaborate with others. [read](ConservationPlan.S24.GiantSeaBass.pdf)

### Diving

I am PADI Advanced Open Water Certified and AAUS Scientific Diving Certified. I occasionally participate in Reef Check California dives but I mostly love to dive recreationally!

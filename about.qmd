My primary task was to identify and tag organisms in photos of the sea floor at various long-term research sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. I worked primarily remotely using ViQi AI software to do this. The aim of the project was to compile detailed ecological data about the same locations over decades to serve as baseline data for many different research projects and other practical applications.

I raised African penguin chicks that had been abandoned or hurt. Daily tasks included preparing food, feeding, cleaning, helping with vet checks, giving medication, and generally monitoring health and behavior. I worked primarily alone in the nursery. The hardest part was to not coddle the adorable chicks because that would reduce their chances of being able to survive in the wild.

I learned so much from working alongside long time bird rehabilitators not only about how to care for birds, but also about the native bird species in the area, their role in the ecosystem, and threats that they currently face. I helped feed, give medication, and clean enclosures for wounded or sick songbirds that were admitted to the facility.

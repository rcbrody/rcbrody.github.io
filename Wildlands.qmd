title: "Wildlands Field Studies in Chile"
---

I completed a 6 week immersive field study course in Northern Chilean Patagonia in winter 2024. I received academic course credit while gaining invaluable hands on experience, friendships, personal growth, and field skills.

Some of the skills/aspects I am most proud of include:

<br>

-   observational skills and field notes

-   planning ahead and problem solving

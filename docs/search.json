    "text": "Coding\nAlthough my coding journey is just beginning, I have already become apt at analyzing data, creating figures, and building websites (like this one!) in Rstudio. I know I have just scratched the surface of coding possibilities, but I have developed the foundational understanding and resourcefulness to learn new coding skills and I am excited to grow them! Here is an example of a figure I made.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBilingualism\nI am fluent in English and Spanish. My mother is a native Spanish speaker so I started speaking Spanish from a very early age. I also went to a Spanish immersion elementary school where I developed Spanish reading and writing proficiency. Being bilingual has enabled me to connect with a broader range of people and expose me to more ideas and cultures. This was part of what inspired me to pursue a minor in Latin American and Iberian Studies.\n\n\n\nWriting\nI have attached some pieces that showcase my writing.\nThis is a research paper I wrote about the role of bilingual education in the Chicano struggle for educational equity for a class called History of Chicanos that I took at UCSB. read\nI took a conservation planning class at UCSB in which we worked for 10 weeks in groups to create a conservation plan. Ours focuses on conserving Giant Sea Bass in California kelp forests. This isnâ€™t all my writing as I worked with 4 other people, but most of it is and it exemplifies my ability to collaborate with others. read\n\n\n\nDiving\nI am PADI Advanced Open Water Certified and AAUS Scientific Diving Certified. I occasionally participate in Reef Check California dives but I mostly love to dive recreationally!"

    "text": "Santa Barbara Long Term Ecological Research Intern (April 2023 - December 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n My primary task was to identify and tag organisms in photos of the sea floor at various long-term research sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. I worked primarily remotely using ViQi AI software to do this. The aim of the project was to compile detailed ecological data about the same locations over decades to serve as baseline data for many different research projects and other practical applications.\n\n\n \n\n\nNursery Intern at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (January 2020 - March 2020)\n\n\n  \nI raised African penguin chicks that had been abandoned or hurt. Daily tasks included preparing food, feeding, cleaning, helping with vet checks, giving medication, and generally monitoring health and behavior. I worked primarily alone in the nursery. The hardest part was to not coddle the adorable chicks because that would reduce their chances of being able to survive in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSongbird Intern at the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network (January 2022 - April 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned so much from working alongside long time bird rehabilitators not only about how to care for birds, but also about the native bird species in the area, their role in the ecosystem, and threats that they currently face. I helped feed, give medication, and clean enclosures for wounded or sick songbirds that were admitted to the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n(top photo from algaeplant.com)(bottom photo from SBWCN website)"

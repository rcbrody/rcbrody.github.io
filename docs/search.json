I not only received academic course credit towards my major, but also gained invaluable hands on experience, friendships, personal growth, and field skills.\nSome of the skills I am most proud of include:\n\nobservations and field notes (when I started paying attention, I started asking questions too!)\nplanning ahead and problem solving on the spot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscientific process and data collection\nbackpacking, camping, and wilderness safety skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nengaging with Patagonian culture\nlearning about broad environmental concepts like succession, volcanoes, glaciers, and climate, and applying them locally to the Los Lagos region of Chile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintrospection and self-reflection"
